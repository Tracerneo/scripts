## rotate-display
This script rotates display and Wacom touch inputs.

### auto-rotate
This little scripts detects when HP tm2's lid is rotated and "closed" turning
it into tablet. In such case, it automaticaly executes rotate-display. Works in
a loop, start it in background. Could be done better, but I don't remember when
I used it last time.

## wacom-display
Simpliest of them all, this script simply binds Wacom tablet to different
display. It's that simple. I don't remember writing it though, so it's possible
that my cat wrote it, since it's in Perl.

## rescreen & wacomset
These two scripts go together.

I leave the analysis of them to you. It's definitely not like I forgot what
they do or anything. They do something with FullHD screen and Wacom. There are
many hardcoded variables. Could be coded better.
