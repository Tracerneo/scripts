# About
This is a repository with various scripts I wrote over the past years. Only the
ones worth noting are included. Files should have license somewhere in them,
otherwise assume public domain.

## [tm2](tm2)
Directory contains various scripts I use with my HP tm2 that has a touch screen
(Wacom Cintiq). Can be useful to anyone with notebook or Wacom tablet.

See it's [readme](tm2/README.md) for more details.

## urxvt-font
Nice helper script changing fonts in rxvt-unicode. Handy when you need to read
Chinese or Japanese in your terminal.

## Other scripts
There are some one-liners, too.

**qinstsize** displays all packages installed on your Gentoo system sorted by
size (ascending) in a pretty way. Requires app-portage/portage-utils.

**name-files** changes names of files to their base64'd md5sums, keeping
extension. Requires xxd command provided by vim-core.
